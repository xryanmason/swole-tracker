# User Guide

This application is under active development, so specifics of the user experience can change.

The following will always stay the same: select the day that you want to track a workout for, add an exercise, and log your set's weight and reps.

## Adding a Workout

When you open the application, you will be presented with a calendar view. You can select a day by tapping on it.

Alternatively, you can select the "Add Workout" button at the bottom of the screen to add a workout for the current day.

## Adding an Exercise

Once you have selected a day, you can add an exercise to your workout by tapping the "Add Exercise" button.

You will be prompted to select an exercise type. If it doesn't exist, you can create one.

## Adding an Exercise Type

If you do not see the exercise type you want to use, you can create a new one by tapping the "Add Exercise Type" button. You will be prompted to enter the name of the exercise type. You can later edit this name, as well as merge it with other exercise types if you accidentally create duplicates.

## Viewing Exercise Type History

Once you have added an exercise type, you can view its history by tapping the 3 dots next to the exercise type name, and selecting "History". This will show you an overview of the last few times you did this exercise. This is helpful for deciding which weight to start with or how many reps to aim for.

## Adding Sets

A set is a combination of weight and reps. You can log your weight and reps by tapping the space below the exercise name.

Once a set is created, you can tap the squares icon to duplicate the set. A long press on this icon will give you additional duplicate options, such as copying just the previous weight, or copying the previous weight plus 5 lbs.

## Adding a Routine

If you plan to do the same exercises on another workout in the future, you can create a routine by tapping the 3 dots next to the workout header, and selecting "Save Routine".

You can later apply this routine to another workout by pressing the creation button in the bottom-right corner of a workout, selecting "From Routine", and selecting the routine you want to apply.
